This is where you'll define long and short labels, as well as icons, for your tables and fields.

![Labels & Icons section](assets/project-editor/Labels-icons-section-4D-for-iOS.png)


* **Short and long labels:** Long and short labels are used according to the available space in the template (to optimize space and avoid overcrowding the tab bar).
* **Icons:** 4D for iOS provides a large library of embedded icons to meet your needs. These include icons for commerce, finance, education, government, health, industry, real estate, services, etc.
* **Formats:** used to control how the values of the fields are displayed (currencies, percents...)

<div markdown="1" class = "tips">

**TIPS**

* To keep everything consistent, **default icons** are generated for blank fields if at least one icon has been defined for a field. 

* You can also leave your the icon area empty if you donâ€™t want to display icons in your application.

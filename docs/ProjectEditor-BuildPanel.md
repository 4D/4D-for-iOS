When you're satisfied that your app is ready, you can launch it in the Simulator to test it.

Letâ€™s take a closer look at the Build tab options:

* <b>Build and Run:</b> Launches the app in the Simulator.

* <b>iPhone X:</b> The default Simulator. Clicking here will reveal a dropdown list with all available simulators.

* <b>Project:</b> Reveals a dropdown list where you can <b>open the project folder</b> or <b>product folder</b>, or <b>open the product with Xcode</b>.

* <b>Install:</b> Installs the application on a connected device.
 

Select a Simulator on which to build and test your app, and press the <b>Build and Run</b> button.

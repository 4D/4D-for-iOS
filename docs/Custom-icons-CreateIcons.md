You can use all icon formats (svg or png is recommended to preserve transparence) and sizes you want and include it in your project. 

It's also highly recommended to have black icons color to visualize them in the project editor.
For this tutorial, you can download the following icons :

<div markdown="1" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
<a class="button"
href="../assets/custom-icons/Custom-Icons.zip">CUSTOM ICONS</a>
</div>

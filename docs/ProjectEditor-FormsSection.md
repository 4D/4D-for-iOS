The Forms section allows you to select both list and detail form templates for each table.

4D for iOS provides various templates with custom transition effects to build fresh and modern iOS applications.

Here's the breakdown of this screen, from top to bottom:

* **List and Detail Forms:** Allows switching between list and detail form definitions for each table.
* **Published tables:** Displays all tables published in the Structure section. 
* **Available Forms:** Allows switching between template selection and content definition.

## List Form definition

Simple, empty templates are used by default for an app's list and detail forms.

Select a template for your first table.
Once done, the content definition screen appears.
You can then drag and drop the fields from the Fields list directly onto the Model displayed on the right.
Most of the list forms include optional Search and Section fields.

## Detail Form definition

As with the List Form definition, select a template and drag and drop your fields onto your detail form.

You can add as few as 2 or as many as 10 fields for most of the List Forms.

**TIPS**
Want to change the template for your list or detail form? 

Field types are automatically recognized, saved, and placed in the appropriate areas for you (depending on the template and field types) when you change templates.

## Gallery

You probably noticed that, when you want to select a template in the form section, a "More" icon is available for both list and detail forms since 4D v18R3.

Just click on that icon to display the entire list.

Then, the only thing you have to do is selecting the template that suits your needs and 4D for iOS will handle all the installation process to help you work faster and more efficiently.

So you can directly start working on the template, as it is ready-to-use.

Next step, you chose a template that suits your needs, but in case something is missing, all you have to do is: 
* go to your resources
* unzip the template
* make the changes needed using Xcode.

## Where to go from here?

* A [tutorial]() is available to guide you through the **action definition process**.

* Another [tutorial]() will help you making **template update** if something is missing.

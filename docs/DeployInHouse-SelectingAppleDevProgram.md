<b>OBJECTIVES</b>

* Choose the appropriate Apple Developer Program.
</div>


You must have a valid Apple Developer account to <b>distribute an iOS app</b>. Apple offers two developer programs:

* [Apple Developer Program for organization](register-apple-developer-program-organization.html) or [for individual](register-apple-developer-program-individual.html) – $99/year 
* [Apple Enterprise Developer Program](register-apple-developer-enterprise-program.html) – $299/year

The main difference between the two programs is:

* <b>Apple Developer Program (for organization or individual)</b>: Allows you to distribute app(s) <b>on the App Store</b>.

* <b>Apple Developer Enterprise Program</b>: Provides resources ONLY for developing and distributing <b>proprietary, in-house apps</b> to employees.

For <b>test purposes</b> you can use a [Free Apple Developer Program](free-developer-account.html).

Here is a chart comparing the different levels of developer membership:

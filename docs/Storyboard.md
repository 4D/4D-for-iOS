## What is a storyboard?

A storyboard allow you to prototype and design multiple user interfaces for your apps using Xcode.

You can
- manipulate and configure basic user interface elements.
- visualise your screen and application flow.

In apple/Xcode world the application screens are called scene or view controller.

üîó[Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/)

### 4D Form vs storyboard

To simplify 4D for iOS use only one application screen by storyboard.

So one storyboard could be equivalent to a 4D form.

### Format of storyboards

Storyboards are XML files.

So we can read and manipulate it while following the official grammar.

There is no Apple specification for the content of this files.

The only things we know is that Xcode produce it, read it and compile it.

‚ö†Ô∏è So be cautious when editing it manually or programmatically.

üí° The command macOS command `ibtool` allow to check the file.

#### Open source effort

Different open sources framework allow to parse it, as 4D for iOS do:

#### Advanced description of the xml files content.

The file contains first a "document" node, which contains a list of scenes.

Then each "scene" contains a "view controller" with a root "view".

And finally there is under this root "view" a hierarchical tree of views.

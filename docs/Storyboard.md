## What is a storyboard?

A storyboard allow you to prototype and design multiple user interfaces for your apps.

You can
- manipulate and configure basic user interface elements.
- visualise your screen and application flow.

In apple/Xcode world the application screens are called scene or view controller.

### 4D Form vs storyboard

To simplify 4D for iOS use only one application screen by storyboard.

So one storyboard is equivalent to a 4D form.

### Format of storyboards

Storyboards are XML files.

So we can read and manipulate it while following the official grammar.

<div markdown="1" class = "objectives">
There is no Apple specification for the content of this files.

The only things we know is that Xcode produce it, read it and compile it.
</div>

<div markdown="1" class = "prerequisites">
ðŸ’¡ The command macOS command `ibtool` allow to check the file.
</div>

#### Open source effort

Different open sources framework allow to parse it, as 4D for iOS do :

#### Advanced description of the xml files content.

The file contains xml first a "document" node, which contains a list of scenes.

Each scene then contains a view controller with a root view.

And finally there is under this root view a hierarchical tree of views.

<div markdown="1" class = "objectives">
document
<div markdown="1" class = "prerequisites">
scenes
<div markdown="1" class = "objectives">
scene 1
<div markdown="1" class = "prerequisites">
view controller
<div markdown="1" class = "objectives">
root view
<div markdown="1" class = "prerequisites">
views
â€¦
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div markdown="1" class = "objectives">
scene 2

â€¦
</div>
</div>
</div>

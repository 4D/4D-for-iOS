**PREREQUISITES**

Click [here](prerequisites.html) to see what you'll need to get started!</div> 

In R5, you can [define actions](actions.html) directly from the Project Editor and execute 4D code from your generated iOS app!

From here, when you build your app from the Project Editor using actions, you can decide to use:

* **4D for iOS templates** from the Form section. In this case, actions are already included for you. You just have to [define actions](define-first-action.html) in the Actions section and create appropriate methods in 4D.

* **your own custom templates** you developed. An important additional step is required for your actions to work in the generated iOS app. Indeed, it is necessary to manually [include action Tags](action-custom-template.html) in your Listform and Detailforms templates.

Now it's time to play building a **Tasks app** that works using 4D for iOS actions.

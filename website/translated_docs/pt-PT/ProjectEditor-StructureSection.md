This section displays all of your database tables and fields exposed by 4D Mobile Service.

![Structure section](assets/en/project-editor/Structure-section-4D-for-iOS.png)

Here, you can define a subset of your physical structure to replicate for mobile devices by selecting specific tables and fields. The selected:

* tables will be automatically added to the tabs of your app.
* fields will be available later when it's time to define your list and detail forms.

**N to 1 relations**

* 4D 17R5 allows you to visualize table relations and select related fields clicking on a relation. Then when your related fields are published, they can be used like any other field in the [app creation process](n-to-one-relations.html).

To help you define your app's structure, multiple filters and a search engine are available to make it easy to select your tables and field.<div class = "tips"> 

**TIPS**

You can publish a selection of fields by pressing the spacebar rather than selecting them one by one.</div>

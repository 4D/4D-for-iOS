If you have issues during the build process, you can open your generated project with Xcode by selecting the **Open the product with Xcode** option from the **Project** Menu.

![Open the project with Xcode](assets/en/debugging/open-project-Xcode.png)

From here, select **launch your application** in the Simulator by clicking on the **Build** button and get all of the logs at the bottom of the Xcode workspace.

## Logger

A logger is an object that allows you to log and trace operations.

For this, we use the [XCGLogger](https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger) framework.

You will find the logger settings definition in your Xcode project/Settings/Settings.plist file.

## Levels

You can filter and display different log levels in your console by adding log.level to your Settings.plist file.

To do so, add a row by right clicking inside the Settings.plist file and enter:
* log.level as **Key**
* Number as **Type**
* 3 as **Value** (for example)

The **available values** are:

* 0 for verbose
* 1 for debug
* 2 for info (default value)
* 3 for warning
* 4 for error
* 5 for severe

For this example, if you set the log.level **Value** to 3, you will get **"warning, error and sever"** in your Xcode console.

## Formato

You can display different visual indicators in the Xcode console to **highlight different log types**.

To do so, just open your Xcode project/Settings/Settings.plist file.
